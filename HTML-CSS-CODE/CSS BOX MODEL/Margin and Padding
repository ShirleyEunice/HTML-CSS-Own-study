*Margin:
Spacing on outside of the element(HTML Tag)

*Padding:
Spacing inside the element rather than choosing width and height. Width and height adjust but
 if content exceeds, it doesn't support to the width and height. So padding allocates and adjust
according to the content and as well as adjust spacing between text and the border.
Default padding on right and left(width)=6px
Default padding on top an bottom(height)=1px
